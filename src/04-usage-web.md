# Web Interface

This guide covers how to use the Konarr web interface to monitor your containers, view SBOMs, manage projects, and track security vulnerabilities.

## Accessing the Web Interface

### Basic Access

Open the server URL in your browser (default port 9000):

```text
http://<konarr-host>:9000
```

**Examples:**

- Local development: `http://localhost:9000`
- Network deployment: `http://your-server-ip:9000`
- Custom domain: `https://konarr.example.com`

### Behind Reverse Proxy

If the server is behind a reverse proxy or load balancer, use the external HTTPS URL configured in `server.frontend.url`.

For reverse proxy setup, see the [Reverse Proxy Setup Guide](02-server-reverse-proxy.md).

### Authentication

The web interface uses session-based authentication:

1. **Session Authentication** - Login through the web interface to obtain session cookies
2. **Admin Access** - Required for server settings, user management, and advanced features
3. **User Access** - Standard access for viewing projects, snapshots, and alerts

- **Application**: Application-specific projects
- **Server**: Host-level projects

### Project Features

- **Hierarchy**: Projects can have parent-child relationships for organization
- **Search**: Use the search/filter box to find specific projects by name, tag, or hostname
- **Status**: Visual indicators show project health and last update status
- **Statistics**: View snapshot counts, vulnerability summaries, and last scan times
- **Setup Workflow**: Streamlined agent deployment instructions for new projects

### Project Setup

For new projects, the setup page provides comprehensive deployment guidance:

- **Agent Configuration**: Ready-to-use commands for container deployment
- **Docker Instructions**: One-line Docker commands with pre-configured tokens

- **Token Management**: Automatic token retrieval for easy agent setup

To access project setup:

1. Navigate to your project
2. Click the "Setup" tab or visit `/projects/{id}/setup`
3. Choose your deployment method (Docker, Kubernetes, or manual upload)
4. Copy and execute the provided commands

## Snapshots and SBOMs

### Understanding Snapshots

Snapshots represent the state of a container or system at a specific time:

- **Automatic Creation**: Generated when agents scan containers
- **Manual Triggers**: Can be triggered through the API or agent commands
- **Versioning**: Multiple snapshots per project show changes over time

### Viewing SBOM Details

Click on any snapshot to access detailed information:

- **Dependencies**: Complete list of packages, libraries, and components with pagination
- **Vulnerability Data**: Security scan results and risk assessments
- **Metadata**: Scan tool information, timestamps, and container details
- **Export Options**: Download SBOM data in various formats (JSON, XML)

### Uploading SBOMs

Projects can now accept manually uploaded SBOM files:

- **Access**: Navigate to project setup page
- **Supported Formats**: JSON and XML SBOM files (CycloneDX, SPDX)
- **Use Cases**:
  - Manual snapshot creation from external scans
  - Import historical SBOM data
  - Testing and validation workflows
- **Process**:
  1. Click "Upload SBOM" button on the project setup page
  2. Select your SBOM file (JSON or XML format)
  3. Confirm upload to create a new snapshot
  4. View the processed snapshot with dependencies and vulnerabilities

### SBOM Standards

Konarr uses industry-standard SBOM formats:

- **CycloneDX**: Primary format for SBOM generation and storage
- **SPDX**: Alternative format support
- **Tool Integration**: Works with Syft, Grype, Trivy, and other scanning tools

### Dependency Navigation

Browse and search through project dependencies:

- **Pagination**: Navigate through large dependency lists efficiently
- **URL Persistence**: Page numbers are preserved in the URL for bookmarking
- **Search Functionality**: Filter dependencies by name or package identifier
- **Details View**: Click any dependency to view detailed information
- **Vulnerability Mapping**: See which dependencies have known vulnerabilities

The pagination feature automatically updates the URL with the current page, making it easy to share specific dependency views with team members.
